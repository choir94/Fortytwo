## Fortytwo Node (CPU VPS Setup)

### Installation

Run this command on your VPS terminal:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/choir94/Airdropguide/refs/heads/main/42.sh -O 42.sh && chmod +x 42.sh && ./42.sh
```

Notes

Recommended specs: 8 GB RAM / 4 CPU

No GPU required
Designed for lower-cost VPS environments
Optimized for stability and easy setup
There are currently no rewards for the Monad ecosystem, so this setup focuses on maintaining efficiency and uptime rather than resource-heavy performance.
